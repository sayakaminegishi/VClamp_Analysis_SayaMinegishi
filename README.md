## Description of each script

**"how_to_use.m"** - example script that demonstrates how to use my scripts.


**"V_clamp_batchAnalysis.m"** - Batch analysis of 1 or more voltage-clamp traces, for a specified interval of time and sweep(s). Gives area under curve (synaptic charge), baseline current, and amplitudes. No need to edit anything. Just click Run.  

**Vclamp_analysis_singlecell.m** - Vclamp trace analysis for a specified region of interest (defined by start and end times in ms), for selected sweeps, for a single specified file.
